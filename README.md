###### E-Commerce Storefront Using React

### Introduction
This project is part of a course assignment during my Front-End Development studies at Noroff, where the goal is to apply my knowledge of React to build a fully functional e-commerce store. The application allows users to browse products, search for products, a fully functional cart and complete a purchase process. Throughout this project, I focused on implementing key React concepts such as component-based architecture, state management using useState and useReducer, and context management using useContext. Additionally, the project incoroporates API integration, responsive design, and a streamlined user interface to create a seamless shopping experience.

### Features
- Browse products with search input
- Add and remove items from cart
- Change quantity of items in cart
- View total price and number of items in cart
- Modal confirmations
- API integration for fetching products and singleproduct
- Responsive design for mobile, tablet and desktop

### Technologies Used
- **React**: Core framework for building the user interface.
- **React-Router-dom**: For routing between different pages of the app.
- **React-hook-form**: Simplified form handling and validation.
- **React-icons**: Icon library used for adding scalable vector icons.
- **Yup**: Schema validation for forms.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Vite**: Development server and build tool for fast project setup.

4. Set Up Environment Variables:
    1. Create a .env file in the root of the project.
    2. Add the necessary environment variables. For example:

     ```
     3. Ensure that .env is added to .gitignore to avoid comitting it to version control.
